# Full Movies from YouTube.

### This was a service which allowed users to watch full movies online (like Netflix). It's powered by scraping the [/r/fullmoviesonyoutube](https://www.reddit.com/r/fullmoviesonyoutube/) subreddit, and then presents the movies with a movie poster and IMDB rating.

### Dependancies:
- PHP Version 5.2.11 or higher. 
- For the mac get [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html), for the PC get [XAMPP](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html).

### How it works:

- Fetches the JSON
- Embeds YouTube video on page
- Gets IMDB info from [IMDBAPI.org](http://imdbapi.org/)

### Features:

- A complete listing of fresh movies
- A "lights off" mode

### Bottom Line:

It's dead simple, and easy to use. Enjoy :)

### Contributors to-do list:

- <s> IMDB integration </s>
- A sexier showing list
